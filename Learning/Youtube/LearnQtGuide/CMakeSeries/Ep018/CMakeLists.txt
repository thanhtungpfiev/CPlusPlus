#[=[

	Show cmake variables in the context of a project
		. Root level
		. Included CMakeLists.txt files
		. Show that 
			. add_subdriectory adds a new variable scope
			. include still works in the global scope. Contrast this with the project in Ep009 where we used include

	Show cache variables 

	Show environment variables (Windows)

	Show how to use functions
        . The create_and_link_executable function will wrap around the commands
            . add_executable
            . target_link_libraries

	Show gui tools 
		. cmake-gui (Windows)
		. ccmake (Linux-Mac)
		. Higlight the three stages of cmake
			. Configuration
			. Generation
			. Build
